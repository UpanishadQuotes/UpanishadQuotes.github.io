Translation:<br>
ALL THIS--whatever exists in this changing universe--should be covered by the Lord. Protect the Self by renunciation. Lust not after any man's wealth.
</p>

<p class="explain">
Notes:<br>
-ALL THIS: That is to say, the universe consisting of ever changing names and forms, held together by the law of causation. <br>
-SHOULD BE ETC: This universe, from the standpoint of Absolute Reality, is nothing but the Lord. That it is perceived as a material entity is due to ignorance. One should view the universe, through the knowledge of non- duality, as Atman alone. <br>
-LORD: He who is the Supreme Lord and the inmost Self of all. He is Brahman and identical with Atnan. <br>
-PROTECT: That is to say, liberate the Self from the grief, delusion, and other evil traits of samsāra in which It has been entangled on account of ignorance. To be attached to matter amounts to killing the Self. <br>
-RENUNCIATION: The scripture prescribes the discipline of renunciation of the longing for offspring, wealth, and the beavenly worlds for him alone who devotes himself entirely to contemplation of the Self as the Lord. Such an aspirant has no further need of worldy duties. It is renunciation that leads to the Knowledge of the Self and protects Its immutability, eternity, and immortality. <br>
-LUST NOT ETC: That is to say, a sannyāsin, who has renounced all de- sires, should not be attached to what he has or long for the property of someone else. Or the sentence may mean that a sannyāsin should not covet wealth at all. For where is the real wealth in the transitory world that he should desire? The ilumincd person renounces the ilusory names and forms because he regards the whole universe as Atman alone. He does not long for what is unreal.
</p>

<p class="explain">
Explanation:<br>
When the truth is known the universe is realized as Atman, the Spirit that dwells in all hearts. The diversity of names and forms, changes, actions, and the rest are superimposed upon Atman through ignorance. These are xtraneous to It and unreal. Day and night the seeker after Truth meditates thus: The Supreme Lord alone dwells in all beings as Atman; this uniy though ultimately unreal, appears to bc real bccause Brahman alone is its ground; since Brahman is my inmost Self, the universe has its root in the Self; it cannot exist independent of Atman. The seeker of Self-Knowledge contemplates the world in this way and covers it by the unitive knowledge. Šankara gives the llustration of sandalwood. Sandalwood is fragrant by nature, but when kept in water for a long time it gives out a bad odour, which, however, is not inherent in it. Again, by rubbing, its natural fragrance is released; and this fragrance covers the foul smell, that is to say, destroys it. Likewise, constant meditation on the reality of Atman and the illusory nature of the universe produces true Knowledge, which reveals everything as the Lord alone.<br><br>

The text lays down the control of lust for wealth as a great spiritual discipline. We cannot know the true nature of the Self because our mind is contaminated by greed, attachment, anger, and carnal desires, all pro- duced by our craving for possessions. The more one is attached to wealth, the less one knows the divinity of the Self. Engrossed day and night in the thought of his possessions, a worldly person inds very little time to think about Atman. Therefore the Ipanishad asks the seeker who wants to protect his spiritual treasure to renounce the craving for material wealth.

Translation:<br>
In this changing world everything is subject to change, yet everything is covered by the Lord. Practise renunciation and be strong in the consciousness of the Self. Do not run after anyone's wealth.
</p>

<p class="explain">
Explanation:<br> 
This world and everything in it is constantly changing. But that which sustains it is never changing. It is always the same. That is the Lord. On Him everything rests. It is like a movie projected on a screen. The movie changes but the screen is constant. Similarly, the phenomenal world is projected on the Lord. It is a mere superimpositionlike seeing a snake superimposed on a rope on a dark night. The snake has no independent existence. It exists because of the rope, and it ceases to exist as soon as a light is brought. The snake then dissolves into the rope. In the same way, when you know Brahman, the world merges into it and you realize that you and Brahman are one and the same. To attain this knowledge is the goal of life. The world then cannot taint you. Your contact with it is merely like that of a piece of sandalwood, which has long been under water and has thereby come to acquire a bad odour. For a while the fragrance of the sandalwood is suppressed and the bad odour prevails. But if the sandalwood is rubbed a little, the bad odour disappears and the natural fragrance of the sandalwood becomes predominant. Similarly, your attachment to the world is temporary. It cannot be permanent. Think of yourself as Brahman, as Pure Consciousness. Think intensely and constantly in this way. The attachment you now have to the world will then go. <br><br>

But how can you attain the knowledge of Brahman? You can attain it by the practice of renunciation. You have to keep reminding yourself that the world, with all its allurements, is not realthat is, it is not real in the sense that it is transitory. Only Brahman is real because it is imperishable. You must renounce this world and concentrate on Brahman. Gold may be alluring, but it is transitory. You should never run after things that are ephemeral. Never covet someone else's wealth, and never become attached to your own wealth.

Translation:<br>
Whatever<sup>1</sup> there is changeful in this ephemeral world,--all that must be enveloped by the Lord. By this renunciation<sup>2</sup> (of the world), support<sup>3</sup> yourself. Do<sup>4</sup> not covet the wealth of anyone<sup>5</sup>.
</p>

<p class="explain">
Notes:<br>
This passage refers to the duty of tie Sunnyāsin who is competent to devote himself exclusivcly to the contemplation of the Ātman.<br><br>

1.	Whatever there is etc.--Just as the bad oxdour of a piece of sandal-wood, produced by continuous contact with water, is covered by its natural, sweet smcll on its beingr rubbed on a stone, so also the changcful and imperfect world of duality is to be obliterated by its being envelopca, througlı contemplation, by the Divinity that is inherent in it as well as in the self of the contemplator. The espressiog changeful ' applied to the world suggests by contrast tiuat the Lord is the one changeless substratum in the fiux of Nature. The word ‘envelopes’ significs that the Lord is both immanent and transcendent.<br>
2.	Renenciation--Contemplation of this kind pre- supposes the zenunciation of worldly life and desires. pertaining to it. <br>
3.	Support yourself--Renunciation helps one to realise the the Ātman and attain the bliss born of it. Ātman Hence the Sannyāsin is asked to. support lhimself by renunciation, in contrast to worldly men who support themselves by the satisfaction of desires.<br>
4.	Do not covet etc.--The Sannyāsin is to seek bliss in renunciation, not in wealth which is the source of all worldly satisfactions.<br>
5.	Anyone--Implies what may belong to oneself as well as to others.

<p class="summary">
Translation:<br>
ALL this, whatsoever exists in the universe, should be covered by the Lord. 
Having renounced (the unreal), enjoy (the Real). Do not covet the wealth of any man.
</p>

<p class="explain">
Explanation:<br>
We cover all things with the Lord by perceiving the Divine Presence everywhere. When the consciousness is firmly fixed in God, the conception of diversity naturally drops away; because the One Cosmic Existence
shines through all things. As we gain the light of wis- dom, we cease to cling to the unrealities of this world, and we find all our joy in the realm of Reality.<br><br>

The word "enjoy" is also interpreted by the great commentator Sankarâchârya as "protect," because knowledge of our true Self is the greatest protector and sustainer. If we do not have this knowledge, we cannot be happy; because nothing on this external plane of phenomena is permanent or dependable. He who is rich in the knowledge of the Self does not covet external power or possession.

<p class="summary">
Translation:<br>
All this--whatsoever moves on the carth--should be covered by the Lord. Protect (your Self) through that detachment. Do not covet anybody's wealth. (Or--Do not covet, for whose is wealth?)
</p>

<p class="explain">
Explanation:<br>
One who lords it over is <i>Īṭ</i>;(<i>Īṭ</i> is derived from the root <i>īś</i>, meaning "to rule" or "to have power".) <i>Īśā</i>, by <i>Īt</i>, by the Lord. He who is the supreme Ruler and supreme Self of all is the Lord. For as the indwelling soul of all, He is the Self of all beings and as such rules all. (So) <i>Īśā</i> (means) by that Lord, in His true form as the Self; <i>vāsyam</i>, should be covered. What (is to be covered)? <i>Idam sarvam yat kim ca</i>, all this whatsoever; <i>jagat</i>, moves; <i>jagatyām</i>, on the earth. All this is to be covered by one's own Self, the Lord, through His supreme reality (present in the realisation): “As the indwelling Self (of all), I am all this”: all that is unreal, whether moving or not moving, is to be covered by its own supreme Self. As the adventitious bad odour of sandal, <i>agaru</i>, etc., resulting from moisture etc., because of their contact with water etc., is covercd up by their natural smells through the process of rubbing those woods themselves, just so, (whatsoever moves on the earth will be abandoned through the contemplation of the Self which is the supremne Truth). "Whatever moves' means the apparent duality, the effect of ignorance, which is characterised by such ideas as doership, enjoyership, etc., and which is superinposed on one's own Self; and the phrase "on the earth" having been used illustratively (for all the worlds), it follows that all the bundle of modifications known as name, form, and action will be abandoned through the contemplation of the Self which is the supreme Truth. He, who is thus engaged in the thought of the Self as God, has competence only for renouncing the three kinds of desire for son etc. (For son, wealth, and worlds (vide Br. IV, iv. 22).), and not for <i>karma</i>. <i>Tena tyaktena</i>, through that detachment. <i>Tyaktena</i> means through detachment, (and not "by any abandoned thing"); for a son or a servant, when abandoned or dead, does not protect one, since he has no connection with oneself. So the meaning of the Vedic word (<i>tyaktena</i>) is "through renunciation <i>Bhuñjīthā</i>, protect. You who have renounced desires, <i>mā gṛdhaḥ</i>, do not covet, do not cherish any desire for wealth. Do not long for <i>kasya svid</i>, anybody's-either your own or somebody else's; <i>dhanam</i>, wealth--this is the meaning. The word <i>svit</i> is a meaningless particle. Or the meaning is this: Do not covet. Why? <i>Kasya svid dhanam</i>, whose is wealth? --this (question) is used in the sense of a denial, because nobody has any wealth which can be coveted. The idea is this: All this has been renounced through this thought of the “Lord”, “All this is but the Self”, so that all this belongs to the Self, and the Self is all. Therefore do not have any hankering for things that are unreal.<br><br>

Translation:<br>
All this is for habitation<sup>1</sup> by the Lord, whatsoever is individual universe of movement in the universal motion. By that renounced thou shouldst enjoy; lust not after any man’s possession.
</p>

<p class="explain">
Notes:<br>
1 There are three possible senses of <i>vāsyam</i>,“tobeclothed”,“tobewornasagarment” and “to be inhabited”. The first is the ordinarily accepted meaning. Shankara explains it in this significance, that we must lose the sense of this unreal objective universe in the sole perception of the pure Brahman. So explained the first line becomes a contra- diction of the whole thought of the Upanishad which teaches the reconciliation, by the perception of essential Unity, of the apparently incompatible opposites, God and the World, Renunciation and Enjoyment, Action and internal Freedom, the One and the Many, Being and its Becomings, the passive divine Impersonality and the active divine Personality, the Knowledge and the Ignorance, the Becoming and the Not-Becoming, Life on earth and beyond and the supreme Immortality. The image is of the world either as a garment or as a dwelling-place for the informing and governing Spirit. The latter significance agrees better with the thought of the Upanishad.</p>
